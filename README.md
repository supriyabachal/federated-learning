# Federated Learning with MNIST

This project demonstrates a simple Federated Learning framework using the MNIST dataset and PyTorch. 

## Features
- Simulates federated learning with 5 clients.
- Uses a simple neural network to classify MNIST digits.
- Implements the Federated Averaging (FedAvg) algorithm.

## Setup
1. Install the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install torch torchvision
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
